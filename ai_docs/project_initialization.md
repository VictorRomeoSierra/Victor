# Victor Project Initialization Summary

## Project Overview
Victor is an AI coding assistant designed to help developers understand and work with the Lua codebase for DCS from XSAF. The system runs locally on a Mac Mini and provides contextual code understanding through various interfaces.

## Accomplishments

### Specifications Created
1. **Project Overview** - Core objectives and success criteria
2. **Model Evaluation Criteria** - Framework for selecting the optimal Ollama model
3. **Technical Architecture** - System components and their interactions
4. **RAG Implementation Design** - Retrieval-augmented generation approach
5. **Implementation Timeline** - Phased project plan
6. **User Interface Specifications** - Web and IDE integration designs

### Initial Implementation
1. **Project Structure** - Created directory structure for the project
2. **Docker Configuration** - Basic docker-compose setup with all required services
3. **Database Schema** - PostgreSQL with pgvector schema for code storage
4. **Embedding Service** - FastAPI implementation for code processing
5. **Lua Parser** - Service for analyzing Lua code into semantic chunks
6. **GitHub Integration** - N8N workflow for automatic updates

## Next Steps

### Phase 0: Complete Setup
- Configure local development environment
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Prepare Docker environment for testing

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Test Ollama models and select initial candidate
- Implement and test the embedding pipeline
- Configure and customize Open-WebUI

## Technical Components Ready for Development
