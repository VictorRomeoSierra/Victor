# Victor Development Kickoff

## Overview
This document outlines the immediate next steps to begin active development of the Victor project. It serves as a guide for the initial development sprint and establishes priorities for the first phase of work.

## Initial Development Priorities

- [ ] Identify representative code samples for testing

**Deliverable**: XSAF codebase analysis document with structure overview, key patterns, and representative samples

**Estimated Time**: 1 week

### 2. Model Evaluation
**Objective**: Select the optimal Ollama model for Lua code understanding.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create a testing framework for model evaluation
- [ ] Pull candidate models to Ollama:
  - [ ] codellama:7b-instruct
  - [ ] codellama:13b-instruct
  - [ ] llama3:8b
  - [ ] wizard-code:7b
  - [ ] deepseek-coder:6.7b
- [ ] Develop test prompts based on XSAF code samples
- [ ] Run evaluation against all models
- [ ] Compare results for:
  - Code understanding accuracy
  - Response quality
  - Performance on Mac Mini
  - Context handling

**Deliverable**: Model evaluation report with quantitative and qualitative results

**Estimated Time**: 1 week

### 3. Database Implementation
**Objective**: Set up the vector database schema in PostgreSQL.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Connect to the existing PostgreSQL instance
- [ ] Create the victor schema and tables
- [ ] Set up pgvector extension and indexes

- [ ] Implement backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Test database performance with sample data

**Deliverable**: Working database schema with verified connectivity

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days

### 4. RAG Middleware Prototype
**Objective**: Create a basic middleware service to integrate with LiteLLM.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Python FastAPI project structure
- [ ] Implement basic request interceptor
- [ ] Create simple vector retrieval integration
- [ ] Develop prompt enhancement logic
- [ ] Test integration with LiteLLM
- [ ] Implement basic logging and monitoring

**Deliverable**: Functional middleware prototype that can enhance prompts with context

**Estimated Time**: 1 week

### 5. Lua Parser Development
**Objective**: Create a specialized parser for Lua code to enable semantic chunking.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research Lua parsing libraries
- [ ] Implement function and module extraction
- [ ] Develop metadata extraction capabilities
- [ ] Create chunking strategy based on code structures
- [ ] Test parser with representative XSAF code
- [ ] Optimize for performance

**Deliverable**: Working Lua parser with semantic understanding capabilities

**Estimated Time**: 1 week

## Development Environment Setup

### Local Development Environment
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up development repository structure
- [ ] Create development virtual environment
- [ ] Configure local development database
- [ ] Set up linting and testing tools
- [ ] Configure local development server

**Deliverable**: Documented development setup instructions

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

### Integration Testing Environment
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Configure test environment with existing components
- [ ] Set up test data and fixtures
- [ ] Create integration test suite
- [ ] Document testing procedures
- [ ] Implement CI workflow for testing

**Deliverable**: Working testing environment with automated tests

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

## Initial Sprint Plan

### Sprint 1 (2 weeks)
**Focus**: Foundation and Analysis

**Goals**:
1. Complete XSAF codebase analysis
2. Select optimal model
3. Implement database schema
4. Create project structure

**Key Milestones**:
- Codebase analysis document completed
- Model selection finalized
- Database schema implemented
- Development environment established

### Sprint 2 (2 weeks)
**Focus**: Core Processing Pipeline

**Goals**:
1. Develop Lua parser
2. Create embedding generation service
3. Implement vector search
4. Build basic RAG middleware

**Key Milestones**:
- Working Lua parser
- Functional embedding pipeline
- Basic retrieval capabilities
- Initial middleware integration

## Team Coordination

### Development Roles
- **Core Developer**: Focus on parser, database, and embedding pipeline
- **Integration Developer**: Focus on LiteLLM integration and middleware
- **Domain Expert**: Provide insights on XSAF codebase and DCS Lua patterns

### Communication Channels
- Weekly progress meetings
- Daily standup check-ins
- Shared development documentation
- Issue tracking system

### Documentation Standards
- Code documentation in docstring format
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Architecture documentation in Markdown
- User documentation in structured format

## Initial Technical Decisions

### Technology Stack Confirmation
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **Embedding Model**: SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 initially)
- **Vector Search**: HNSW algorithm via pgvector
- **Middleware Communication**: REST API with JSON

### API Design Principles
- RESTful endpoints for resource operations
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Comprehensive error handling and status reporting
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigations
1. **XSAF Codebase Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with smaller, well-defined modules
   - Mitigation: Incremental approach to parsing and understanding

2. **Model Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Evaluate multiple models early
   - Mitigation: Implement fallback strategies

3. **Integration Challenges**
   - Mitigation: Create standalone prototypes first
   - Mitigation: Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

4. **Resource Constraints**
   - Mitigation: Optimize for Mac Mini resources
   - Mitigation: Implement caching strategies

## Success Metrics for Initial Phase
- Working parser for >90% of Lua files
- Retrieval of relevant context for test queries
- Response time under 5 seconds for standard queries
- Successful integration with existing LiteLLM setup

## Next Planning Milestone
After the completion of Sprint 2, we will conduct a review and planning session for the next phase of development, focusing on UI enhancements and deeper integration.
