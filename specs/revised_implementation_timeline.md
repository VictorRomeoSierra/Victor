## Risk Factors and Mitigation

- **Integration Complexity**: The integration of dcs-lua-analyzer may reveal unexpected challenges; maintain regular checkpoints and adjust approach as needed
- **Model Performance**: If initial Ollama models don't perform well enough on Lua code, we may need to evaluate additional models or consider fine-tuning options
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The Mac Mini has finite resources; implement efficient processing and caching strategies
- **Code Complexity**: The XSAF codebase may be more complex than anticipated; start with smaller, well-defined subsets
- **User Adoption**: Involve key users early in testing and feedback to ensure the tool meets actual needs
