# Victor Project Specification Index

## Overview
This document serves as an index to all specification documents created for the Victor project - an AI coding assistant for Lua development in DCS.

## Core Specifications

### [Project Overview](project_overview.md)
The main project specification document outlining core objectives, technical requirements, and success criteria.

### [Project Summary](project_summary.md)
A comprehensive summary of the project goals, architecture, and implementation approach.

## Technical Specifications

### [Model Evaluation](model_evaluation.md)
Criteria and process for evaluating different Ollama-compatible models to select the best option for the Victor AI coding assistant.

### [RAG Implementation](rag_implementation.md)
Details of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Multi-Context Programming (MCP) implementation.

### [Refined Integration Plan](refined_integration_plan.md)
Current integration strategy leveraging Open-WebUI, LiteLLM, and Ollama with the core components from dcs-lua-analyzer.

## Infrastructure and Implementation

### [Existing Infrastructure](existing_infrastructure.md)
Documentation of the current infrastructure components that are already set up and operational.

### [Revised Implementation Timeline](revised_implementation_timeline.md)
Phased implementation plan accounting for existing infrastructure components.

### [Development Kickoff](development_kickoff.md)
Immediate next steps to begin active development, including initial sprint planning.

### [Implementation Checklist](implementation_checklist.md)
Comprehensive checklist for the full implementation of the Victor project, including n8n integration for GitHub workflows.

### [LiteLLM Direct Integration](litellm_direct_integration.md)
Strategy for direct integration of LiteLLM with dcs-lua-analyzer core components, bypassing the middleware.

## Additional Documentation

### [Initial Prompt](../.claude/initial_prompt.md)
The original project prompt and requirements saved for reference.

### [Project Initialization Summary](../ai_docs/project_initialization.md)
Summary of accomplishments from the initial project setup phase.

## Getting Started

For new team members, we recommend reviewing the documents in this order:
1. [Project Summary](project_summary.md) - For a high-level overview
2. [Existing Infrastructure](existing_infrastructure.md) - To understand current setup
3. [Refined Integration Plan](refined_integration_plan.md) - For the current technical approach
4. [Implementation Checklist](implementation_checklist.md) - For development plan

## Document Maintenance

These specifications should be treated as living documents that will evolve as the project progresses. Updates should be tracked in the git history, and major revisions should be noted in the documents themselves.
