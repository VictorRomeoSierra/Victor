# N8N Workflow Fixes for Ollama Integration

## Issues Found in victor_ollama_chat_workflow.json

1. **Missing "Respond to Webhook" Node**
   - The workflow ended at "Format Response" without explicitly responding
   - This caused the webhook to return empty responses

2. **Incorrect Webhook Configuration**
   - Used `responseMode: "lastNode"` with webhook v1
   - Should use `responseMode: "responseNode"` with webhook v2

3. **Outdated Node Versions**
   - HTTP Request nodes were v3 (should be v4.2)
   - Code nodes were v1 (should be v2)

4. **HTTP Request Body Format Issues**
   - Victor API call used `bodyParameters` array format
   - Should use `specifyBody: "json"` with `jsonBody`

## Fixed Version

The fixed workflow (`victor_ollama_chat_workflow_fixed.json`) includes:

1. **Added "Respond to Webhook" node** at the end of the flow
2. **Updated webhook configuration**:
   - Changed to `responseMode: "responseNode"`
   - Upgraded to webhook typeVersion 2
3. **Updated all node versions** to match the working workflow
4. **Fixed HTTP request formats** to use proper JSON body specification
5. **Simplified the flow** by using a Merge node instead of complex routing

## How to Use

1. Import `victor_ollama_chat_workflow_fixed.json` into N8N
2. Activate the workflow
3. The webhook will be available at: `https://n8n.victorromeosierra.com/webhook/victor-local-chat`

## Testing

Use the test script:
```bash
cd ~/Dev/Victor
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/test_n8n_ollama_workflow.py
