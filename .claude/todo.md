# Victor Project TODO List
Last Updated: May 23, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### System Integration
- [x] Victor API deployed and running with integrated RAG
- [x] Database populated with 37k XSAF code chunks
- [x] N8N workflow configured and working
- [x] Open-WebUI integration complete with 9 model-specific functions
- [x] End-to-end pipeline tested and working

### Recent Accomplishments
- [x] Created Open-WebUI pipe functions for all Ollama models
- [x] Fixed timeout issues (increased to 120 seconds)
- [x] Cleaned up test files and organized deployment docs
- [x] Documented the complete working system

## üìã Pending Tasks

### High Priority

1. **GitHub Webhook RAG Ingestion Pipeline** (NEXT PRIORITY)
   - [ ] Create N8N workflow to receive GitHub webhook events
   - [ ] Set up webhook endpoint for XSAF repository push events
   - [ ] Create Victor API endpoint for triggering reindexing
   - [ ] Implement incremental indexing (only changed files)
   - [ ] Add notification system for indexing status
   - [ ] Handle branch filtering (main, master, vrsDevelopment branches)
   - [ ] Add error handling and retry logic
   - [ ] Create monitoring dashboard for ingestion pipeline

2. **Claude N8N Pipeline Integration** ‚úÖ
   - [x] Create Open-WebUI function for the original N8N Claude workflow
   - [x] Test integration with Claude API through N8N
   - [x] Configure function to use the existing webhook endpoint
   - [ ] Add support for streaming responses from Claude

3. **Streaming Response Implementation**
   - [ ] Research N8N streaming capabilities (Server-Sent Events)
   - [ ] Modify N8N workflows to support streaming from Ollama/Claude
   - [ ] Update Open-WebUI functions to handle streaming responses
   - [ ] Test streaming with both Ollama and Claude models
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling for stream interruptions


2. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Analyze slow query patterns
   - [ ] Implement Redis caching for frequent queries
   - [ ] Optimize vector similarity search parameters
   - [ ] Add query result caching with TTL

### Medium Priority

1. **Documentation & User Guides**
   - [ ] Create comprehensive user guide for Victor system
   - [ ] Document common DCS/XSAF query patterns
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Add architecture diagrams

2. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - [ ] Set up Prometheus/Grafana for metrics
   - [ ] Track query response times
   - [ ] Monitor model usage patterns
   - [ ] Create dashboard for system health

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - [ ] Create Open-WebUI quick prompts for common DCS tasks
   - [ ] Add custom CSS styling for Victor responses
   - [ ] Implement code syntax highlighting in responses

### Low Priority / Nice to Have

1. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Multi-file context support
   - [ ] Project-wide refactoring suggestions
   - [ ] Integration with DCS mission editor
   - [ ] Support for other DCS frameworks (MOOSE, Mist)

2. **Development Tools**
   - [ ] VSCode extension for Victor integration
   - [ ] CLI tool for direct Victor queries
   - [ ] API client libraries (Python, JavaScript)

## üöÄ Next Immediate Actions

1. **GitHub Webhook Setup**
   ```bash
   # In N8N, create new workflow:
   # Webhook trigger ‚Üí Victor API reindex ‚Üí Notification
   ```

2. **Performance Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run load tests on Victor API
   # Identify bottlenecks in query processing
   ```

3. **Documentation Sprint**
   - Write user guide
   - Create video tutorial
   - Document best practices

## üìù Notes

- System is fully operational for DCS/XSAF queries
- All core functionality is working
- Focus now shifts to optimization and enhancement
- Consider user feedback for prioritization
